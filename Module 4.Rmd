a matrix is a collection of vectors stored together; they can only store data of one class; created using the matrix() function

m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
m

m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE)
m

m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
m

v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
v2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)
m1 <- rbind(v1, v2)
m1

m2 <- cbind(v1, v2)
m2

class(m1)
dim(m1)
class(m2)
dim(m2)
colnames(m2)
rownames(m2)

str(m2)

arrays are more general data structures that can include additional dimensions

a <- array(data = 1:90, dim = c(5, 6, 3))
a

v <- 1:100
v

v[1:15]

v[c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)]

v <- 101:200
v[seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 2)]


# Challenge 1

#create a vector of 1 word character strings comprising the first line of the Ulysses
v <- "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed."

v2 <- gsub("[[:punct:]]","",v)


# extract every third element of this vector
# need help with this
v3 <- str_split(v2, " ")
v3

# Challenge 2

m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)
m

x <- m[c(2, 3, 6), ]
x

x <- m[ ,c(6,7,8)]
x

x <- m[c(2:6), c(2:9)]
x

# Challenge 3
a <- matrix(data= 1:400)
